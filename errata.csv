10,"On page 188, there are a series of typos, all due to an error in code block 61.

Finally, in the text that follows, the sentence “If we use 0.5 as the predicted probability cut-off for the classifier, then we have a problem: none of the test observations are predicted to purchase insurance.” should be corrected as follows: “If we use 0.5 as the predicted probability cut-off for the classifier, then we have a problem: only two of the test observations are predicted to purchase insurance.” ", Lauren Chen,True,188
