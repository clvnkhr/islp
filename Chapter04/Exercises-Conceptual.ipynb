    "Suppose that we take a data set, divide it into equally-sized training and test sets, and then try out two different classification procedures. First we use logistic regression and get an error rate of 20 % on the training data and 30 % on the test data. Next we use 1-nearest neighbors (i.e. K = 1) and get an average error rate (averaged over both test and training data sets) of 18 %. Based on these results, which method should we prefer to use for classification of new observations? Why?\n",
